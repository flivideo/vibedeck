  "prompt": "A VibeDeck controller as an ancient magical artifact from a wizard's tower. Leather-bound edges like a spellbook. Brass gears and clockwork visible inside. Glowing runes and arcane symbols etched into the surface. Crystal buttons that pulse with inner light. The rotary knob is a mystical orb. Old parchment texture. Candle wax drips. The LCD shows magical script. Dusty tome aesthetic. Candlelit dramatic lighting.",
  "why": "Fantasy genre appeal, magical mystery"
