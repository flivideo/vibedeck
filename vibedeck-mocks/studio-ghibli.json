  "prompt": "A VibeDeck controller as if it were a magical artifact from a Studio Ghibli film. Whimsical, hand-crafted looking with slight imperfections. Warm brass and copper tones with verdigris patina. Small decorative details - tiny stars, moons, nature motifs. The rotary knob looks like an ancient compass. Soft magical glow emanates from within. Cozy, enchanted, like something Howl would own. Warm dreamy lighting.",
  "why": "Magical whimsy, beloved aesthetic, emotional appeal"
