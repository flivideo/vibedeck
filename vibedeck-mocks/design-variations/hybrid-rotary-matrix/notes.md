## Design Rationale

Combines the best of both interaction models:
- **Rotary knob** for quick scrolling/selection (current VibeDeck concept)
- **Button matrix** for direct access to frequent functions (Stream Deck strength)

This hybrid tests whether "best of both worlds" creates a superior product or unnecessary complexity.

## Key Features

- Large central rotary encoder (brushed aluminum, knurled)
- 6 LCD buttons on left (2 rows x 3)
- 6 LCD buttons on right (2 rows x 3)
- OLED display above rotary
- 4 action buttons at bottom (YES, NO, mic, SEND)
- Wider form factor

## Design Questions This Answers

- Is the hybrid approach better than pure rotary or pure matrix?
- Does the wider form factor feel premium or unwieldy?
- How should buttons and rotary divide responsibilities?
