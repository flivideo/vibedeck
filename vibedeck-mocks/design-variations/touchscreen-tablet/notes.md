## Design Rationale

Touchscreen offers maximum flexibility:
- Interface completely customizable via software
- No fixed button layout limitations
- Can simulate rotary, sliders, or any UI pattern
- Future-proof - new features via software updates

Tests whether physical controls are essential or if touch-first is viable.

## Key Features

- 5-inch capacitive touchscreen (main interface)
- Customizable grid of touch buttons and sliders
- Thin tablet form factor (iPad mini inspired)
- 2 physical buttons on right edge (confirm/cancel)
- Small rotary encoder on top edge
- Kickstand for angled desktop use
- Space gray aluminum body

## Design Questions This Answers

- Are physical controls essential for "vibe coding" or is touch sufficient?
- Does a touchscreen feel premium or like a cheap tablet?
- Can haptic feedback replace physical button satisfaction?
- Is software flexibility worth the loss of tactile controls?
