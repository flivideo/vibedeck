## Design Rationale

Stream Deck is the dominant product in the macro pad space. This design tests whether VibeDeck should adopt a similar button-matrix approach for:
- Familiarity with existing users
- Proven UX patterns
- Direct access to functions without navigation

## Key Features

- 4x3 grid of LCD buttons (12 total)
- Each button shows customizable icons/text
- OLED status bar at top
- Compact rectangular form factor
- Matte black aluminum housing

## Design Questions This Answers

- Should VibeDeck be a button matrix instead of rotary-centric?
- Is the Stream Deck form factor optimal for AI coding workflows?
- How many buttons are needed for effective operation?
