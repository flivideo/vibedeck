  "prompt": "A VibeDeck controller folded entirely from origami paper. Crisp geometric folds creating the 3D form. White paper with visible fold lines and creases. The buttons are small folded paper squares. The rotary knob is a complex origami spiral fold. Delicate, precise, mathematical beauty. Perhaps some sections in colored paper - red, gold. The cable is a paper chain. Soft even lighting showing the paper texture and shadows in the folds.",
  "why": "Craft aesthetic, geometric beauty, unexpected material"
