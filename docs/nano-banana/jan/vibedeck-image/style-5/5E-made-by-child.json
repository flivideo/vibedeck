  "prompt": "A VibeDeck controller as if designed and decorated by a 5-year-old child. Crayon drawings all over it - sun, stick figures, house, rainbow. Wobbly hand-drawn letters for the button labels. Stickers stuck randomly - dinosaurs, stars, hearts. Glitter glue smeared on parts. The colors don't stay in the lines. Innocent, joyful, imperfect. The rotary knob has a smiley face drawn on it. Displayed proudly on a refrigerator with magnets. Bright cheerful lighting.",
  "why": "Emotional warmth, innocence, unexpected charm"
