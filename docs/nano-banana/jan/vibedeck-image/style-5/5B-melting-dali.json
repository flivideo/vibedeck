  "prompt": "A VibeDeck controller melting like a Salvador Dali clock. The body is drooping and warping, draped over an edge. Buttons are sliding off, stretched like taffy. The rotary knob is elongated and bent. The LCD screen display is distorted and running. Surrealist dreamscape. Time and reality bending. Soft desert background with long shadows. Everything is melting but still somehow functional. Warm surreal lighting.",
  "why": "Art statement, surrealist appeal, memorable image"
